# MIPS-Assembly
A snake game programmed in MIPS Assembly Lnaguage
To open the snake game, you need to download the Mars with syscall 100 first.
You need to enter a number between 4000 to 8000 to determine the sustain time of the food.
You need to set a ranodm seed as well. Then using "w", "a", "s", "d" to conrol the ðŸ‘† ðŸ‘ˆ  ðŸ‘‡ ðŸ‘‰ movement of the snake.
By controlling a snake, your target is to eat a predefined number of food items, while at the same time, avoid head colliding with borders or intersecting with snake itself. Note not all food items are edible, some are poisonous. Eating edible food items lengthens the snake and leads to a next level, then eventually, to a victory. Eating a poisonous food item shortens the snake and may lead to a game loss.
